## Bandwith

Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given amount of time, gigabits per second (Gbps).

How Bandwidth Works
Data Transmission Capacity: Think of bandwidth as the capacity of a pipe, not the speed of the water flowing through it. A wider pipe (higher bandwidth) can carry more water (data) at once.

What to Consider
Throughput: While bandwidth is the maximum theoretical capacity, throughput is the amount of data that actually makes it to your destination in a given time, considering factors like network speed and latency.

## 十分鐘對網絡流分析積為50GB範圍作為合理值
~ 2Gbps /8 *60 * 10 120GB 1G+1G 光纖
~ DATA 100GB (-20GB HEADER partiat)
~ 長方形積, 化作三角形積(因為常見考慮峰值形狀)的話, 10分鐘的積為50GB範圍作為合理值
